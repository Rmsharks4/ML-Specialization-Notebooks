    "##### Exercise-1: XGBoost: Fit/Predict\n",
    "It's time to create your first XGBoost model! As Sergey showed you in the video, you can use the scikit-learn .fit() / .predict() paradigm that you are already familiar to build your XGBoost models, as the xgboost library has a scikit-learn compatible API!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll be working with churn data. This dataset contains imaginary data from a ride-sharing app with user behaviors over their first month of app usage in a set of imaginary cities as well as whether they used the service 5 months after sign-up. It has been pre-loaded for you into a DataFrame called churn_data - explore it in the Shell!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to use the first month's worth of data to predict whether the app's users will remain users of the service at the 5 month mark. This is a typical setup for a churn prediction problem. To do this, you'll split the data into training and test sets, fit a small xgboost model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set by computing its accuracy."

    "Now, instead of attempting to cherry pick the best possible number of boosting rounds, you can very easily have XGBoost automatically select the number of boosting rounds for you within xgb.cv(). This is done using a technique called early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping works by testing the XGBoost model after every boosting round against a hold-out dataset and stopping the creation of additional boosting rounds (thereby finishing training of the model early) if the hold-out metric (\"rmse\" in our case) does not improve for a given number of rounds. Here you will use the early_stopping_rounds parameter in xgb.cv() with a large possible number of boosting rounds (50). Bear in mind that if the holdout metric continuously improves up through when num_boost_rounds is reached, then early stopping does not occur."

    "Okay - so you have your categorical columns encoded numerically. Can you now move onto using pipelines and XGBoost? Not yet! In the categorical columns of this dataset, there is no natural ordering between the entries. As an example: Using LabelEncoder, the CollgCr Neighborhood was encoded as 5, while the Veenker Neighborhood was encoded as 24, and Crawfor as 6. Is Veenker \"greater\" than Crawfor and CollgCr? No - and allowing the model to assume this natural ordering may result in poor performance.\n",

    "As a result, there is another step needed: You have to apply a one-hot encoding to create binary, or \"dummy\" variables. You can do this using scikit-learn's OneHotEncoder (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)."

Specifically, you'll be able to impute missing categorical values directly using the Categorical_Imputer() class in sklearn_pandas, and the DataFrameMapper() class to apply any arbitrary sklearn-compatible transformer on DataFrame columns, where the resulting output can be either a NumPy array or DataFrame.\n",

    "In this exercise, your task is to apply the CategoricalImputer to impute all of the categorical columns in the dataset. You can refer to how the numeric imputation mapper was created as a template. Notice the keyword arguments input_df=True and df_out=True? This is so that you can work with DataFrames instead of arrays. By default, the transformers are passed a numpy array of the selected columns as input, and as a result, the output of the DataFrame mapper is also an array. Scikit-learn transformers have historically been designed to work with numpy arrays, not pandas DataFrames, even though their basic indexing interfaces are similar."
